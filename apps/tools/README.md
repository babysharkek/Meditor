# OpenCut Tools

## Why this exists

I needed to replace a color in an image the other day.

Spent 20 minutes trying to find a tool that wasn't shit.

**Site 1:** Can't paste images. Have to download my clipboard image, upload it, then delete it. Immediately close tab.

**Site 2:** Can't paste images either. Close.

**Site 3:** Finally! Paste support! Oh wait—massive "UPGRADE TO PRO NOW" popup blocks the entire screen. Close popup. UI has 500 buttons everywhere. Okay whatever, let's try the color picker... **NO EYEDROPPER**. A color replacement tool with no way to select colors from the image. The most obvious feature. Not there.

Now I have to open ANOTHER site just to extract the hex code from my image. Google "extract color from image". Find a site. Upload image again. Get the color. Copy hex code.

Go back to the replacement site. Paste the hex. Click replace.

**It didn't even work.**

Started over. Sat there for 10 minutes and it eventually worked.

## The no-bullshit version

Every image/video tool on the internet has the same problems:

- Can't paste images
- Paywalls for basic features
- Aggressive popups and ads
- Bloated UIs
- Missing obvious features (eyedroppers, copy result, etc)
- Can't batch process
- Tracking your every move
- Login to use the tool

**OpenCut Tools is different:**

- ✅ Paste images directly
- ✅ Every tool has the features you'd expect
- ✅ Copy results
- ✅ No login required for free tier
- ✅ Minimal, clean UI
- ✅ Privacy-first (we don't want your data)
- ✅ Batch processing
- ✅ No ads, no popups, no bullshit

Free for most users. Premium ($8/month) for power features like batch processing and advanced tools.
